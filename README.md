# What is "Project W"
A codename for a project that has no name. The goal of this project is to create a stationary bike computer that tracks the workout statistics.
It's currently split into two repositories - Arduino and Electron

# What is included in this repository
This repository is a modification of another repository by [reefab](https://github.com/reefab) named [CyclingPusher](https://github.com/reefab/CyclingPusher).
I have removed from his version the networking involved, since I don't need it, because everything is processed on the Windows tablet and the output, so my Electron app can fetch the information.
